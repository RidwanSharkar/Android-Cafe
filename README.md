________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Overview:**

The Android Café app is intended to be a template for any Café or Restaurant, which may offer a selection of menu items, e.g. sandwiches, donuts, and coffee. 

• Staff can manage orders in real-time, while Customers can personalize their orders with various options, including different flavors and add-ins. 

• The app dynamically calculates and displays subtotals, taxes, and total costs as orders are assembled, implementing a Singleton Design Pattern to ensure consistent shopping cart information across android activities.

• Orders can be placed and stored and exported for later review.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Employs object-oriented design principles (OOP), Singleton Design Pattern, and Model, View, and Controller components (MVC Architecture). 

• Models encompass the business logic and data structures of any menu item, which can be further subcategorized and utilize Inheritence and Polymorphism for consistency across varieties. 

• Views consist of JavaFX for the graphical user interface and FXML for defining the layouts.

• Controllers consist of activity classes that manage user interactions and application logic (onClick & event handlers).
