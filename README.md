Café App (Android) 

Overview:

The Android Café app is intended to be a template for any Café, which may offer a selection of menu items, e.g. sandwiches, donuts, and coffee. Staff can manage orders in real-time, while Customers can personalize their orders with various options, including different flavors and add-ins. The app dynamically calculates and displays subtotals, taxes, and total costs as orders are assembled, implementing a Singleton Design Pattern to ensure consistent data across android activities. Additionally, it allows for later review of orders with export functionality.

Employs object-oriented design principles (OOP) as well as Model, View, & Controller components (MVC Architecture). The Model encompasses the business logic and data structures - menu items can be further subcategorized and utilize Inheritence and Polymorphism for consistency across varieties. The Views consist of JavaFX for the graphical user interface and FXML for defining the layouts, while the Controller consists of activity classes that manage user interactions and application logic (onClick & event handlers).
